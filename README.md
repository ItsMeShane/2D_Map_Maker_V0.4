# 2D_Map_Maker_V0.4
A 2D map editor designed for creating a number map which my game (next project) will convert into a visual map. Contains over 1900 unique 32x32 tiles.

Improved performance by only rendering whats on screen. This was meant to be implented much sooner 
but wasnt a priority as it was only really needed for laptops.

added a new tool: the eye dropper. 
the eye dropper allows you to choose a tile on the map and set it as your selected tile.

when filtering your tiles, the scroll bar will now adjust its size based on your sorting type. 
this still isnt perfect and the size is just an estimate on how much space you will need.
this is a short term fix until i can be bothered to do it properly.

this update also comes with new icons for each tool.
